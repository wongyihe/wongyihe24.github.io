# Introduction

- **Turn-taking** is essential for autistic children to develop social skills [3].
- **Visual support** from computational technologies can present the structure and routine that children need to understand abstract information [2].
- **We proposed to visualize the turn-taking process in the game StarRescue to improve social behaviors for children with high-functioning autism.**

    **RQ1.** *What feedback do parents and teachers have on the effectiveness of StarRescue in improving the social behavior of children with HFA?*

    **RQ2.** *What are the design insights of StarRescue for improving children's social behaviors with HFA?*




# Design Objectives

The development of our collaborative tablet-based game that would engage and encourage HFA children to improve their collaboration skills, especially turn-taking, was guided by three objectives:
    1. to support HFA children in learning to collaborate in a turn-taking manner
    2. to enable players to learn to interact with others while completing their own tasks
    3. to reinforce good social behaviors and encourage continued learning.

# Design process

# The Game Design of StarRescue

## **Levels Progression**

We combined and tailored Collaborative Patterns [1] with Collaboration Patterns [4] and formulated a new **four-stage conceptual model of collaboration to guide our design of the four-level difficulties**.


| ![level 0](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_level0.png) | **Practice Mode - Build Self-Confidence** <br> - familiarize the children with their tasks and build confidence when performing a task in front of a partner. <br> - allowed players to practice individually, supporting self-directed learning |
| ![level 1](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_level1.png) | **Level 1 - Understand Responsibility** <br> - introduces the role of the partner <br> - clarifies the scope of player responsibilities|
| ![level 2](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_level2.png) | **Level 2 - Unitizing Unique Functionalities** <br> - aware of the necessity of each other's participation <br> - assign different functionalities (superpowers)|
| ![level 3](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_level3.png)| **Level 3 - Free Collaboration** <br> - encourages children to freely explore different ways of collaborating with their partners |

**Game Mechanism & Characters**

We have two types of monsters.

| ![normal monsters](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_normalmonsters.png) |![normal monsters](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_normalmonsters_onattack.png) |
| *normal monsters (always keep still)* | *attack 3 times to eliminate* |
| ![flying monsters](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_flyingmonsters.png) |![flying monsters](/images/portfolio/starrescue/starrescue_flyingmonsters_onattack.png) |
| *flying monster (flying around in a spaceship)* | *use the frozen ball to stop moving, and then fireball to destroy **(use superpowers)*** |


**Reward System**

Players receive a reward when they can successfully take turns bouncing the balls.

The reward system has a twofold benefit:
    - Get a sense of achievement
    - Symbolize one's membership in the group

# Study Method

# Initial Findings

- Ball movement can make children willingly wait for their turn and augment turn-taking
- In-game interaction can draw children's attention to people
- In-game reinforcements can encourage children to play
- Tablets can be a feasible intervention device

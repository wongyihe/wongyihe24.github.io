# Introduction

- **Turn-taking** is essential for autistic children to develop social skills [3].
- **Visual support** from computational technologies can present the structure and routine that children need to understand abstract information [2].
- **We proposed to visualize the turn-taking process in the game StarRescue to improve social behaviors for children with high-functioning autism.**

    **RQ1*.** What feedback do parents and teachers have on the effectiveness of StarRescue in improving the social behavior of children with HFA?*

    **RQ2.** *What are the design insights of StarRescue for improving children's social behaviors with HFA?*


# Design Objectives

- The development of our collaborative tablet-based game that would engage and encourage HFA children to improve their collaboration skills, especially turn-taking, was guided by three objectives:
    1. 1) to support HFA children in learning to collaborate in a turn-taking manner
    2. 2) to enable players to learn to interact with others while completing their own tasks
    3. 3) to reinforce good social behaviors and encourage continued learning.

# The Game Design of StarRescue

## **Levels Progression**

- We combined and tailored Collaborative Patterns [1] with Collaboration Patterns [4] and formulated a new **four-stage conceptual model of collaboration to guide our design of the four-level difficulties**.

**Practice Mode - Build Self-Confidence**

- familiarize the children with their tasks and build confidence when performing a task in front of a partner.
- allowed players to practice individually, supporting self-directed learning

**Level 1 - Understand Responsibility**

- introduces the role of the partner
- clarifies the scope of player responsibilities

**Level 2 - Unitizing Unique Functionalities**

- aware of the necessity of each other's participation
- assign different functionalities (superpowers)

**Level 4 - Free Collaboration**

- encourages children to freely explore different ways of collaborating with their partners

**Game Mechanism & Characters**

- Normal monsters - *attack 3 times to eliminate*

- Flying monsters - *use the frozen ball to stop moving, and then fireball to destroy **(use superpowers)***

**Reward System**

- Players receive a reward when they can successfully take turns bouncing the balls.

- The reward system has a twofold benefit:
    - Get a sense of achievement
    - Symbolize one's membership in the group

# Study Method

# Initial Findings

- Ball movement can make children willingly wait for their turn and augment turn-taking
- In-game interaction can draw children's attention to people
- In-game reinforcements can encourage children to play
- Tablets can be a feasible intervention device
